# Custom Behance Portfolio

Today I wanted to try the behance API to recover some of my projects posted on there. I want to update my webpage and I'll use what I'd learned in this project in the nre version of my webpage

## In this project I used

 - Less
 - LessHat
 - Remixins
 - Foundation Icons
 - Animate.css
 - Jquery
 - Magnific Popup
 - Handlebars Templates
 - Behande API users endpoint
 - Behande API projects endpoint
